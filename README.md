# RestaurentApp
This application is very simple and similarly we can create more pages for an full management application.

1. First Signup and then Login using the email and password you provided in the signup page
2. After that you will be redirected to the main page Restaurent Dashboard where you can Add Restaurent User Details, Edit, Delete and Save all the records and also you can logout at the end.

# To run the Project
